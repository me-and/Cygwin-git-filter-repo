NAME='git-filter-repo'
VERSION=2.34.0
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY='Devel Python'
SUMMARY='Quickly rewrite git repository history (filter-branch replacement)'
DESCRIPTION="git filter-repo is a versatile tool for rewriting history, which includes
capabilities not found anywhere else. It roughly falls into the same space of
tool as git filter-branch but without the capitulation-inducing poor
performance, with far more capabilities, and with a design that scales
usability-wise beyond trivial rewriting cases."

	# The official installation instructions want the Python module
	# installed as a symlink to the script in the executable directory.
	# That's a pain to do in cygport, seems a bit fragile in general on
	# Cygwin given the possibility of users changing how Cygwin is
	# implementing symlinks, and saves less than 200KB.  Just install the
	# script as a duplicate.
